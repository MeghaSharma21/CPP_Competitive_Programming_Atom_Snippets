# CPP: Competitive_Programming Atom Snippets
A collection of code snippets for competitive programmers, written in C++ for atom editor.
---

Many a times it happens in competitive programming competitions that you&#39;ve figured out an algorithm for the solution of the problem, which happens to be a standard algorithm. How helpful would it be to have snippets for the commonly used concepts/algorithms in that situation, to provide you an edge over the fellow competitors. Using snippets will improve your accuracy, speed and hence rank!

This repository provides extension for atom-text editor which enables atom users to use c++ coding snippets of algorithms while doing competitive programming.

## Installation

- For installation, type Ctrl + Shift + P.
- Select Settings View:Install Packages And Themes
- Then search for cpp-competitive-programming-snippets in Packages tab.
- Restart atom.
